# mini-games
A host of mini-blogs (a.k.a. mini-games) used to hone my python programming skills related to software design, algortihms, scientific analyses etc. As you may quickly realized, there is no central theme to this repository, just good wholesome, nerdy fun. To make matters more interesting we introduce some rules...

# The Rules
---
1. Under no circumstances am I allowed to use any external python packages other than the following (if you don't believe my, checkout the environment.yml file for proof):
    * [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) for all matrix math that I am too lazy to program myself
    * [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) for all plotting purposes
2. All solutions will be explained via notebooks (no source code files). This is mainly to keep each mini-blog independent of each other so that the repo is easy to maintain.
3. All functions & classes must be developped in a test-driven manner
4. All solutions will be posted using the latest version of python (this appears to be python 3.9.1 as of December 8th, 2020). This isn't really a rule, but so be it! 

**TLDR**: No pandas, no scikit-learn, just me & python. 

# Contents
As I continue to upload new mini-blogs, I will provide a description of their contents here. Notebooks will be grouped into folders based on the type of information being covered. I will seperate each folder in as sub-headers.

### Section: Design of Computer Programs

This section covers extracurricular analyses done during my progression through this fantastic (and difficult) [python programming course](https://www.udacity.com/course/design-of-computer-programs--cs212?irclickid=1XKxDiz42xyLR7UwUx0Mo36DUkEyL815TR4DXI0&irgwc=1&utm_source=affiliate&utm_medium=&aff=315774&utm_term=&utm_campaign=__&utm_content=&adid=786224) taught by [Peter Norvig](https://norvig.com/).
