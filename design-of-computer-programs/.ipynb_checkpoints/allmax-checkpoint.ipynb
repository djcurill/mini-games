    "As I work through the course [Design of Computer Programs](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/cs212/lessons/48688918/concepts/487235700923) I want to log my solutions as individual mini-notebooks in attempt to improve upon Peter Norvig's solutions. I am currently working through the first lessons of the course where we design a piece of software that scores poker hands. \n",
    "\n",
    "As we near the end of the lesson, we begin to refactor some functions to create a more flexible program. In its current state, the program is incapable of handling ties. That is, there is always just 1 winner. To account for this, Peter Norvig proposes the creation of a helper function call `allmax` that returns all values equivalent to the maximum. \n",
    "\n",
    "Wherever possible, it is smart to apply [test-driven development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) where we write tests that define the expected behaviour of the function before we *actually* write the function. This practice promotes simpler software design and in my opinion, introduces less testing error due to bias than writing code, follows by testing. \n",

    "The tests below elegantly define the behaviour of the `allmax`. It is a simple wrapper around the python `max` function. The only difference is it must return multiple values wherever numerous maximums coexist. "

    "# My Final Statement\n",

    "Yes, Peter's solution is faster. Yes, this notebook is certainly overkill for designing such a simple function, but it highlights an important aspect when designing computer programming. If we consider the application at hand, we are designing a helper function that computes the winning poker hand. In the game of poker, we likely will have 2-7 people playing at a time, not 10,000. So is speed really necessary? \n",
    "\n",
    "To save my ass for writing slow code, I say no. The difference in computation times will be so marginal, no one would ever notice in real time! Instead, we should emphasize readability and elegance for the sake of the programmers and developpers who must maintain the codebase. That being said, many would argue that Peter's solution is more easily understandable should you not be familiar with functional programming. So maybe I did all of this for nothing ;). \n",
    "\n",
    "**TLDR**: \\ Fast code is great, but so is readable code! Play to to your audience, and understand when it is more suitable to optimize for speed vs. elegance. "
