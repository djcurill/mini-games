    "# Breaking it Down\n",
    "---\n",
    "In high school *I always loved math but I despised the written problems*. I hated the abundance of words and their convoluted introductions. I struggled to break down the material into anything tangible. Clearly I have come a long way since I am now writing a blog that uses python to solve a riddle.\n",
    "\n",
    "I really like the idea of mapping a riddle solution to code for a couple of reasons:\n",
    "1. To solve the riddle you must *break down* the problem down into valuable pieces of information (an important skill in for a developper)\n",
    "2. Complex problems don't require complex solutions!\n",
    "\n",

    "The narrator has provided the following clues:\n",
    "1. The 8 founders started the 4 houses in pairs. Each individual was a founder of exactly one house.\n",
    "2. No pair of founders with same color hats founded the same house.\n",
    "3. No pairs of founders with the same symbols on their hats founded the same hats.\n",
    "4. Funflame and Imaginez founded Gianteye and Longmous (in some order)\n",
    "5. Miraculo and Rimbleby Longmous and Meramaid (in some order)\n",
    "6. Septimus didn't found Vidopnir\n",
    "\n",
    "# Data Representation\n",
    "---\n",
    "* We know that each house has exactly 2 founders. This tells us that a house should be a *Collection* (i.e. list, tuple, or set) of some sort. \n",
    "* There are 8 unique founders, each having a pre-assigned `color` and `symbol` attribute (key word \"attribute\"). This makes the riddle fairly different from the [zebra puzzle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zebra_Puzzle), and therefore the same solution proposed by Peter Norvig will not apply! \n",
    "* The `name` attribute of each founder will be very important when solving the riddle computationally since it allows us to immediately accept / reject simulations. This will become more clear later on.\n",
    "* A class representation for the founder should be simple enough. Each `Founder` object has 3 attributes: (1) Name, (2) Color and (3) Symbol.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start by writing a simple class representation for the founders. We use the python native dataclass module to make our class definition nice and clean. Run the cell below to see how our Founder class is represented as an output."

    "That being said, we should estimate the total number of computations to get an idea of how our algorithm will perform. This is an important step before spending considerable time trying to optimize this algorithm for speed. Furthermore, in attempt of increasing speed, our solution will inevitably begin to look less elegant. Don't mean to brag, but the final solution is pretty sexy.\n",
    "\n",
    "The bulleted list below highlights my thought process when trying to determine the number of operations:\n",
    "* There are 8 unique founders, so the number of permutations are $8! = 40,320$. \n",

    "* Looking into this a bit more, we perform 9 operations to check if an element is contained in a list. For anyone who is curious, the array operation of checking for inclusion has an algorithm complexity of $O(n)$, where n is the length of the list. The great news is, all of these lists are only of length = 2. This suggests that we perform $9 * 2 = 18$ basic operations when checking for inclusivity (worst case scenario). \n",
    "\n",
    "* The last \"if\" statement checks that all *houses* are compatible with each other (thanks to the beauty of operation overloadin!). Working it out, this is approximately 12 operations (4 iterations, 4 additions and a check for ALL statments being true for a list og length =4). Let's round up to 20 to account for the operation overloading that comes with the addition of two `Founder` classes, and likely some other errors I have made thus far). \n",
    "\n",
    "* Putting this all together, we have ~40-50 iterations contained within our loop that at most runs 40,320 times. So the total number of operations is somewhere between: $ 40 * 8! \\le n \\le 50 * 8!$. I extended the upper bound to 50 to really account for the likelihood of mistakes.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Considering the worst case scenario of 50 total operations, this algorithm will have to run ~2 million times, which is nothing for a modern day computer!! If you don't believe me, run the cell below that creates a list of 2 million entries. It only take ~75ms, give or take some error.\n",
